Program to calculate the hadronic decay widths of a scalar particle with mass between 2GeV and 3.7GeV.
The main part of the program is the ScalarHadronizer class implemented in scalarhadronizer.py
In the parameter_fits jupyter notebook the open parameters are optimized and different outputs and graphs are created.
The DECAY.XML file is taken from EvtGen https://evtgen.hepforge.org/
